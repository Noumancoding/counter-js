# Counter App

A simple little project to help me practice JavaScript DOM manipulation. It shows a number and lets you increase, decrease, or reset it using buttons.

## Why I Built This

I wanted to improve my logic, practice real-time DOM changes, and get more confident with writing JavaScript from scratch. Also learning how to make clean commits and host projects on GitHub.
